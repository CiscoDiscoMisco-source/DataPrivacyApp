- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major funcionality
- Avoid making mayor changes to the patterns or architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructred
- Awlays thik about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
